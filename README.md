# Facebook Messenger for Home Assistant

This is my upgrade for Facebook integration. Following things were added:
1. Target map
You can assign human readable names to sid and use it instead of n-digits user id.
2. Sending media files like pictures.
Under Attachment attribute you can use media_type and media tag to easily send media.
It was not possible using default integration
